**Live Stock Market Analysis**
* This project combines a Django backend and a ReactJS frontend to provide a live stock market analysis application.

**Backend**
* The backend of the application has been developed using Django. It utilizes JWT authentication for user login and retrieves data from the database. This ensures secure and efficient access to user-specific information.

**Frontend**
* The frontend of the application is built using ReactJS. It provides real-time stock market data and displays it on a candlestick chart. This chart allows users to visualize the stock market trends and patterns effectively.

* The integration of Django backend and ReactJS frontend ensures a seamless user experience and efficient data processing for live stock market analysis.

* Please note that the full source code and detailed documentation for this project are available within the respective backend and frontend directories.
